Task : Build a student success prediction model
Description: Use historical data to predict student success in internship programs based on
their profile features and participation metrics.
Hints: Preprocess data carefully (handle missing data, normalize). Try classification
algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM. Evaluate models using
accuracy, precision, recall.
